# Resources
The aim of this repository is 
 - To keep track of all the books I have read on computer science topic.  
 - To share the knowledge with the general public here.
 - To share free but cool online learning environments.
 
 >**Disclaimer**: Some of the readings here are completed as part of the essential reading for my undergrad. The remaining however, are consumed entirely out of personal interest.
